>     I'd just like to interject for a moment. <br>What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. <br>Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

  It's me, the local Linux wizard at it again.<br>
  My current home on desktop is the one and only Void Linux, while my servers have to put up with the good ol' Ubuntu Server.<br>
  My specialties are keeping servers stable & secure, overcomplicating simple issues, casual sarcasm and shell scripting.<br>
